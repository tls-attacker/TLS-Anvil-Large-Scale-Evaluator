# TLS-Testsuite-Large-Scale-Evaluator

The TLS-Testsuite-Large-Scale-Evaluator provides a setup to execute the [TLS-Testsuite](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Testsuite) against multiple TLS implementations running in Docker containers ([TLS-Docker-Library](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Docker-Library)) in parallel.
 
It was developed as part of the master's thesis *Development and Evaluation of a TLS-Testsuite* at the *Ruhr-University Bochum* in cooperation with the *TÃœV Informationstechnik GmbH*.
