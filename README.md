# TLS-Anvil-Large-Scale-Evaluator

The TLS-Anvil-Large-Scale-Evaluator provides a setup to execute the [TLS-Anvil](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Anvil) against multiple TLS implementations running in Docker containers ([TLS-Docker-Library](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Docker-Library)) in parallel.
 
It was developed as part of the master's thesis *Development and Evaluation of a TLS-Testsuite* at *Ruhr University Bochum* in cooperation with the *TÃœV Informationstechnik GmbH*.

cd TLS-Anvil-Large-Scale-Evaluator
mvn install -DskipTests

```
